# finder (truecaller)

a command line tool for searching text files in a linux directory.

## code structure

To understand the code structure we have 2 main packages -> cli, files.

- cli package as the name suggests it manages command line. I have used kong package here.
- files package handles scanning files and directories and operations performed in them.
- main.go is our starting point to read the code.
